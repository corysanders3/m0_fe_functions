# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of? I am most proud of the functions performed in the functions.js exercise. They were really difficult and therefore I felt more accomplished after completing them. I do not think I did the 5th exercise correct, but we were able to get the desired result.
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications? Functions are a powerful tool because you can use them in many different ways. They can also store information that can be called upon throughout your code.
